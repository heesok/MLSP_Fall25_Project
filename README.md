### Codes
`scripts/`
- `NMF_BSS.ipynb`: Implementation of the NMF-based blind source separation method.
- `ica.py`: Implementation of the ICA-based blind source separation method.
- `utils.py`: Utility function for loading and preprocessing audio files before evaluation, including resampling to match sample rates and trimming to align lengths.
- `plot_quantitative_results.ipynb`: Quantitative evaluation script computing MSE, SDR, SIR, and SAR for all methods.
- `plot_qualitative_results.ipynb`: Qualitative evaluation script visualizing pitch tracks and MFCC features for comparison.
